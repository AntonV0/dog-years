## Project #21 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
By typing a value in the myAge variable, this JavaScript app logs your age in dog years. Dog years are calculated using arithmetic operators with the following logic:
  - First 2 years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each
  - Each year after equates to 4 dog years
## What I Learned
  - Arithmetic operator shorthand *=
  - Reassinging variables
  - The .toLowerCase() string method
